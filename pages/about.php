                            <p>IYSA has been established since the end of 2018 and as long as IYSA was

                            established and held various competitions, we saw many students and stu-
                            dents who were interested in making projects in the eld of life sciences. It is

                            proven by the dominance of their project in this eld in every competition
                            held by IYSA.</p>

                            <p>Therefore, our Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA) in collaboration
                            with Food Science and Technology Department, Bogor Agricultural University

                            (IPB) and BUCA IMSEF Turkey will hold an international-level Invention com-
